# Getting started with Blockly

## Codelab overview

### What you'll learn

This codelab will teach you how to modify a simple web app to include the [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) visual programming library.

### What is Blockly?

Blockly is a library for building block programming apps. Block programming allows users to create scripts and programs by using visual blocks, even if they do not know any programming language. Blockly includes everything you need for defining and rendering blocks in a drag-n-drop editor. Each block represents a chunk of code that can be easily stacked and translated into code. It can be used to let users customize components and add behaviors to parts of the app.

### What you'll build

MusicMaker, a web  app where you can program buttons to play different sounds, using Blockly.

### What you'll need

-  Chrome web browser
-  [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb), or your own web server of choice
-  A text editor
-  Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
-  The sample code, see **Get setup** section for instructions

This codelab is focused on Blockly. The app structure, non-relevant concepts and code are glossed over and are provided for you to simply copy and paste.

## Setup

### Download the sample code

You can get the sample code for this code by either downloading the zip here:

[Download zip](https://github.com/google/blockly/archive/master.zip)

or by cloning this git repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/blockly.git
```

If you downloaded the source as a zip, unpacking it should give you a root folder `blockly-master`.

The blockly repository contains several versions of the app:
- `demos/codelab/app/`: The starting code that you'll build upon in this codelab.
- `demos/codelab/app-complete/`: The code after completing the codelab, in case you get lost or want to compare to your version.

## Install and verify web server

TODO(fenichel): Remove web server integration if not needed.

While you're free to use your own web server, this codelab is designed to work well with the Chrome Web Server. If you don't have that app installed yet, you can install it from the Chrome Web Store.

[Install Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)

After installing the Web Server for Chrome app, click on the Apps shortcut on the bookmarks bar:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

In the ensuing window, click on the Web Server icon:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

You'll see this dialog next, which allows you to configure your local web server:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

Click the **choose folder** button, and select the blockly root folder. This will enable you to serve your work in progress via the URL highlighted in the web server dialog (in the **Web Server URL(s)** section).

Under Options, check the box next to "Automatically show index.html", as shown below:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

Then stop and restart the server by sliding the toggle labeled "Web Server: STARTED" to the left and then back to the right.

![image](insert_image_url_here)

Now visit your site in your web browser (by clicking on the highlighted Web Server URL). In the browser, navigate to the **demos/codelab/app** directory. You should see a page that looks like this:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

## Explore the app

Duration: 5:00

### Play Mode

By default, the app launches in "**Play Mode**". In this mode, you can see 9 buttons. None of them can do anything yet. The idea is to let user define custom behaviors for each button, using Blockly.


![image](insert_image_url_here)

### Edit mode

By tapping the **EDIT** button, you can switch to edit mode. In this mode, tapping a button will display an editor, which is where you can program how sounds should play for that button. For now, the editor screen is empty.

![image](insert_image_url_here)

You can go back to the play mode by tapping **SAVE** and then **DONE** buttons.

## Add Blockly libraries


Now that you know what you'll be building, let's add Blockly dependencies to the app.

1. Navigate to `demos/codelab/app/.`
1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.

## Add Blockly javascript libraries

At the end of `index.html` you can see two scripts being imported:

-  `scripts/main.js` - this is the main logic for the app. Currently it has all the code needed to navigate and switch between views in the basic app
-  `scripts/music_maker.js` - a small library to play sounds. It will be used by our Blockly code to actually play sounds in the browser.

Add Blockly scripts just before these two scripts. The order is important, because we will use Blockly objects later in main.js.
First, include the core Blockly script and the core blocks set.

```html
<script src="../../../blockly_compressed.js"></script>
<script src="../../../blocks_compressed.js"></script>
```

Then include the messages the blocks are using for the user's language (in this case English):

```html
<script src="../../../msg/js/en.js"></script>
```

These paths assume the codelab's relative location in the source code. When building your own app it should be the relative path to your version of these files.

TODO(fenichel): Either use the npm import, or point to blockly-samples to show how to include it in other ways.

TODO(fenichel): Decide if the code should be in blockly-samples.


## Add Blockly workspace

In `index.html`, in the `<main>` section, you can see a div with the id "blockly-div":

```html
<div id="blockly-div" style="height: 480px; width: 400px;"></div>
```

This is where we will insert a lockly editor. The div has a defined width and height, because we will insert a [fixed size workspace](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/fixed-size) into it.

A Blockly workspace consists of two parts:
- An area where the blocks to be converted to code are assembled
- A toolbox containing all blocks that are available to user.

![image](insert_image_url_here)


## Define Blockly toolbox

TODO (fenichel): Decide whether to use the new JSON representation (not until it's released and debugged?)
TODO (fenichel): Use es6 for sample code, and use a multiline string here.

Let's define the toolbox. Add the structure of the toolbox just after the `blockly-div`:

```xml
<xml id="toolbox" style="display: none">
  <category name="Loops" colour="120">
    <block type="controls_repeat_ext">
      <value name="TIMES">
        <shadow type="math_number">
          <field name="NUM">5</field>
        </shadow>
      </value>
    </block>
  </category>
</xml>
```

This XML defines a toolbox with a single "repeat loop" block inside a single category named "Loops".


For more information on this XML format and toolbox configuration, click <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/toolbox">here</a>.

We set the display style of the toolbox to `none`, because we do not intend to display the XML structure on our web page - it will be just used to construct the toolbox programmatically.

## Add Blockly workspace to the edit view

Now open `scripts/main.js`. Just before the end of the main function, add code to inject Blockly editor:

```js
Blockly.inject('blockly-div', {
  media: '../../../media/',
  toolbox: document.getElementById('toolbox'),
  toolboxPosition: 'end',
  horizontalLayout: true,
  scrollbars: false
});
```

Let's look at the options we used to initiate blockly editor:

- `media`: A directory where blockly can find the assets it is using, like icons etc.
- `toolbox`: An XML element which defines the toolbox for the editor
- `toolboxPosition`: Where the toolbox should be positioned
- `horizontalLayout`: Layout type, can be horizontal or vertical
- `scrollbars`: whether to show scrollbars in the workspace.

Now refresh the page. Select the EDIT mode, then tap on one of the buttons. You should see a Blockly editor:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

Tap on the Loops category. You should be able to drag and drop the available loop block to the workspace and back.

## Create custom block


Next, we want to add a custom "play sound" block to our workspace:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

### Create sound block script file.

To define a custom block in Blockly, it must be specified inside a js file. Create a JS file to define a new "play sound" block:

1. Add `sound_blocks.js` file in the `scripts` directory.
1. Add the following code to `sound_blocks.js`:

```js
Blockly.defineBlocksWithJsonArray([
  {
    "type": "play_sound",
    "message0": "Play %1",
    "args0": [
      {
        "type": "field_dropdown",
        "name": "VALUE",
        "options": [
          ["C4", "sounds/c4.m4a"],
          ["D4", "sounds/d4.m4a"],
          ["E4", "sounds/e4.m4a"],
          ["F4", "sounds/f4.m4a"],
          ["G4", "sounds/g4.m4a"],
          ["A5", "sounds/a5.m4a"],
          ["B5", "sounds/b5.m4a"],
          ["C5", "sounds/c5.m4a"]
        ]
      }
    ],
    "previousStatement": null,
    "nextStatement": null,
    "colour": 355,
    "tooltip": "",
    "helpUrl": ""
  }
]);
````

The JSON inside `defineBlocksWithJsonArray` call describes how the block looks like, e.g. its color, content, types of connectors etc. The `type: "play_sound"` property defines the block's name, which we will use to inject the block to our workspace.

For more information on the JSON structure defining the block, click <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/define-blocks">here</a>.

### Add the sound block to the toolbox

![image](insert_image_url_here)

```html
<script src="scripts/sound_blocks.js"></script>
```

Now we can update the toolbox to include the new sound block.

The XML structure for toolbox already contains a "**Loops**" category. After that category, add a "**Sounds**" category that includes our custom `play_sound` block:

```xml
<xml>
  <category name="Loops" colour="120">
    ...
  </category>
  <category name="Sounds" colour="170">
    <block type="play_sound"></block>
  </category>
<br>
</xml>
```

Run the app one more time, and play around with the new "**Sounds**" category and the new "Play (sound)" block. It should look like this:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

This step discussed how to manually define custom blocks in Blockly. Once you've completed the entire codelab, we recommend that you check out our <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/blockly-developer-tools">developer tools</a>, which helps automate part of this process.

## Save/load workspace

Once the button behavior is defined by the user, it needs to be saved for later use.

## Add the save method

Open `scripts/main.js`. Add the following code to the `save()` method:

```js
let xml = Blockly.Xml.workspaceToDom(Blockly.getMainWorkspace());
button.blocklyXml = xml;
```

This method takes the Blockly workspace, exports it to an XML DOM structure and stores it in a `blocklyXml` property on the button. This way an exported xml for the block sequence gets associated with a particular button.

### Add the load method

Similarly, when a user opens the editor, the blocks previously associated with this button should get loaded into the workspace.

In the `scripts/main.js `file, add `loadWorkspace` function:

```
function loadWorkspace(button) {
  let workspace = Blockly.getMainWorkspace();
  workspace.clear();
  if (button.blocklyXml) {
    Blockly.Xml.domToWorkspace(button.blocklyXml, workspace);
  }
}
```

It clears the workspace from any blocks and then loads the blocks defined in the XML in `blocklyXml` property of the clicked button.

Call this function from `enableBlocklyMode `method:

```
function enableBlocklyMode(e) {
  ...
  loadWorkspace(currentButton);
}
```

Now, test the code. Edit the workspace for one of the buttons, add some blocks, save it, and reopen it. The workspace should still contain the blocks you added.

## Generate JavaScript code

Duration: 7:00
Now that each button can be configured with its own Blockly workspace, the next thing we want to do is to generate JavaScript code from each workspace.

This generated code will be run by the browser, effectively executing the blocks set up in the Blockly workspace.

### Add a blockly generator for javascript

Blockly can generate code from blocks for different languages, e.g. JavaScript, Python, or PHP. Let's add the JavaScript generator to our app.

![image](insert_image_url_here)

```html
<script src="../../../javascript_compressed.js"></script>
```

It will be used by `sound_blocks.js`, so be sure to add the script tag for `javascript_compressed.js` above the `sound_blocks.js` script.

### Add a JavaScript generator for the sound block

When Blockly generates JavaScript code for blocks in a workspace, it translates each block into code. By default, it knows how to translate all library-provided default blocks into JavaScript code. However, for any custom blocks, we need to specify our own translation functions (aka. code generators).

![image](insert_image_url_here)

```js
Blockly.JavaScript['play_sound'] = function(block) {
  var value = '\'' + block.getFieldValue('VALUE') + '\'';
  return 'MusicMaker.queueSound(' + value + ');\n';
};
````

With this translation function, the following `play_sound` block:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

translates into the JavaScript code "`MusicMaker.queueSound('Sounds/c4.m4a');`".

## Run generated code

When a button is pressed, we want to execute the custom code associated with it.

![image](insert_image_url_here)

First, load the workspace content associated with the pressed button:

```js
loadWorkspace(event.target);
```

Next, generate the code out of that workspace:

```js
Blockly.JavaScript.addReservedWords('code');
var code = Blockly.JavaScript.workspaceToCode(
  Blockly.getMainWorkspace());
code += 'MusicMaker.play();';
```

Because the code is "written" by the user, we do not have full control over its contents. This is why we added `'code'` to the list of reserved words so that if the user's code contains a variable of that name it will be automatically renamed instead of colliding.

The user's code will consist of many `MusicMaker.queueSound` calls. At the end of our generated script, add `MusicMaker.play `call to play all the sounds added to the queue.

Finally, execute the script with the eval function. Wrap it in a try/catch so that any runtime errors are logged to the console, instead of failing quietly.:

```js
try {
  eval(code);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

The end result should look like this:

```js
function handlePlay(event) {
  loadWorkspace(event.target);
  Blockly.JavaScript.addReservedWords('code');
  var code = Blockly.JavaScript.workspaceToCode(
      Blockly.getMainWorkspace());
  code += 'MusicMaker.play();';
  try {
    eval(code);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

Executing scripts with eval is not always the safest option - we use it here for simplicity. If you intend to run the user's blocks in production, check out the <a href="https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter">JS Interpreter project</a>. This project is separate from Blockly, but was specifically written for Blockly.

Run the app and try it out! Edit one of the button to play a C4 sound 5 times:

![image](insert_image_url_here)

Save and exit the edit mode. Now if you tap this button, you should hear the C4 sound played 5 times.
